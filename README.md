# Data Science with Python Internship Projects  

**Intern:** Harsh  
**Domain:** Data Science with Python  
**Organization:** Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.  
**Duration:** November 2025

##  Task 1 – Student Performance Analysis  

- Loaded and analyzed the **Student Performance Dataset (`student-mat.csv`)**  
- Cleaned data, removed duplicates, and handled missing values  
- Performed descriptive statistics to answer key questions such as:  
  - Average `G3` (final grade)  
  - Correlation between `studytime` and `grades`  
- Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

##  Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis & Sales Performance  

- **Part A:** Performed **EDA** on a simulated retail dataset  
  - Detected outliers, analyzed sales/profit distribution, and built a correlation heatmap  
- **Part B:** Built a **Linear Regression model** to predict *Sales* using *Profit* and *Discount*  
  - Evaluated performance using **R²** and **MSE**  
  - Visualized insights with histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and pie charts

##  Task 3 – Customer Segmentation using Clustering  

- **Objective:** Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and apply **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.  
- **Dataset:** Synthetic customer dataset with variables — *Age, Annual Income, Spending Score*.  
  *(The original `customer_data.csv` link was unavailable; a realistic dataset was generated. The notebook includes instructions to swap it for the real one if obtained.)*  

- **Steps Covered:**  
  - Data cleaning & scaling using `StandardScaler`  
  - Optimal cluster selection via **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**  
  - KMeans clustering and visualization using **PCA**  
  - Pairplot & centroid interpretation for insights  
  - Actionable business recommendations

##  Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Methods:** EDA, Regression, Clustering (KMeans), PCA Visualization  
- **Environment:** Google Colab + GitHub Integration

##  Outcome  
Successfully completed all three internship assignments demonstrating skills in:  
- Data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis  
- Predictive modeling using regression  
- Unsupervised learning for customer segmentation  

Each project was executed, documented, and published via Google Colab → GitHub workflow for transparent and reproducible results.
