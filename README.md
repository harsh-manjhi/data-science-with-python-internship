# Data Science with Python Internship Projects

**Intern:** Harsh  
**Domain:** Data Science with Python  
**Organization:** Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.  
**Duration:** November 2025

##  Task 1: Student Performance Analysis
- Loaded and analyzed the **Student Performance Dataset (student-mat.csv)**  
- Cleaned data, removed duplicates, handled missing values  
- Performed descriptive statistics and answered questions such as:
  - Average G3 score
  - Correlation between studytime and grades
- Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

##  Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Sales Performance
- **Part A:** Performed EDA on a simulated retail dataset  
  - Detected outliers, analyzed sales/profit distribution, correlation heatmap  
- **Part B:** Built a simple **Linear Regression** model predicting *Sales* using *Profit* and *Discount*  
  - Evaluated with R² and MSE  
  - Visualized trends and patterns with histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and pie charts

##  Task 3: Customer Segmentation using Clustering

- **Objective:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and apply **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their purchasing characteristics.
- **Dataset:** Synthetic customer dataset created with variables — *Age, Annual Income, Spending Score*.  
  (The original `customer_data.csv` link was unavailable, so a realistic dataset was generated. The notebook includes instructions to replace it if the real file becomes available.)
- **Steps Covered:**
  - Data cleaning & scaling using `StandardScaler`
  - Optimal cluster selection via **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**
  - Application of **KMeans** and visualization using **PCA**
  - Pairplot and centroid analysis to interpret clusters
  - Business insights and recommendations for marketing strategies
